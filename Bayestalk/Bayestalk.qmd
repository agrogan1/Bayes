Bayesian statistics are often touted as the *new statistics*, that should perhaps supplant traditional *frequentist* statistics. 

## Advantages

Bayesian statistics have the advantage of being able to incorporate prior information (e.g. clinical wisdom & insight, community knowledge, results of meta-analyses and literature reviews). 

Bayesian statistics also have the advantage that we are not simply deciding whether to reject the null hypotheses, $P(D|H_0)$ but are rather able to evaluate the probability of a hypothesis, $P(H|D)$. In essence, this means that we can sometimes decide to *accept* the null hypothesis, rather than *failing to reject the null hypothesis*.

## Disadvantages

However, Bayesian statistics may be difficult to understand. Further, while statistical software for Bayesian inference is becoming easier and easier to use, syntax for Bayesian inference may remain complicated and counter-intuitive 

Lastly, the advantages of being able to *incorporate prior information* and to *accept the null hypothesis* may be overstated: *prior information* may be difficult to come by; and social science may be able to move forward quite well without the ability to *accept null hypotheses*.

In this presentation I hope to at least introduce some of these ideas, and to generate some discussion of them.

Thinking through Bayes is *hard*. We perhaps learn best by doing.
