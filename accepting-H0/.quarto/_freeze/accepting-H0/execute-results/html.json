However, even from a traditional *frequentist* statistical perspective, it may be helpful to think about the *value* of results that are *not statistically significant*.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n## Statistical Power\n\nA finding of a *null result* is dependent on having enough statistical power that one might plausibly detect an effect were an effect to exist.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Important Substantive Cases\n\nThe Value of Accepting the Null Hypothesis $H_0$\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\" lightable-paper lightable-hover\" style=\"font-family: Roboto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> case </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> description </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> H_0 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> example </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Equivalence Testing </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Equivalence Of 2 Treatments Or Interventions </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $$\\beta_1 = \\beta_2$$ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> The effect of Treatment 1 is indistinguishable from the effect of Treatment 2 (especially important if one treatment is much more expensive, or time consuming than another). </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Equivalence Testing </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Equivalence Of 2 Groups On An Outcome </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $$\\bar{y_1} = \\bar{y_2}$$ or in multilevel modeling $$u_0 = 0$$ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> People identifying as men and people identifying as women are more similar than different with regard to psychological processes (Hyde2005). </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Retiring Interventions </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> There Is No Evidence That Intervention X Is Effective </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $$\\beta_{intervention} = 0$$ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Evidence consistently suggests that a particular treatment has near zero effect. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Contextual Equivalence </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Equivalence of a Predictor Across Contexts (Moderation) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $$\\beta_{interaction} = 0$$ or in multilevel modeling $$u_k = 0$$ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Warm and supportive parenting is equally beneficial across different contexts or countries. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Family Member Equivalence </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Equivalence of a Predictor Across Family Members </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $$\\beta_{parent1} = \\beta_{parent2}$$ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Parenting from one parent is equivalent to parenting from another parent </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Full Mediation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Association of x and y Is Completely Mediated; No Direct Effect </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $$\\beta_{xmy} \\neq 0$$ $$\\beta_{xy} = 0$$ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> The relationship of the treatment and the outcome is completely mediated by mechanism m. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> No Mediation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> No Indirect Effect; Association of x and y Is Not Mediated by m </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $$\\beta_{xmy} = 0$$ $$\\beta_{xy} \\neq 0$$ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> The relationship of the treatment and the outcome is not mediated at all by mechanism m. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Theory Simplification </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Removing An Association From A Theory </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $$\\beta_x = 0$$ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> There is no evidence that x is associated with y. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Theory Rejection </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Rejecting A Theory </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $$\\beta_{theory} = 0$$ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> There is strong evidence (contra Theory X) that x is not associated with y. </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n# References\n",
